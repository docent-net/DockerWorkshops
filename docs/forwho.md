## Who should attend ##

Workshops will be open and free for everyone; keep in mind that there's some
entrance level of knowledge you should have in order to be able to fully
understand and solve workshops tasks. You should be sysadmin with good CLI
skills and experience with virtualization techniques (at least know the difference between hypervizor type 1,2 and containers).

Keep in mind that we will be using Vagrant which will help us deploy and build
workshop environments.
